                <h2>Everything Is Tuberculosis (Signed Edition): The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection</h2>
                <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px;">John Green</p>
                <h4>John Green, the #1 bestselling author of The Anthropocene Reviewed and a passionate advocate for global healthcare reform, tells a deeply human story illuminating the fight against the world's deadliest disease. Signed edition</h4>
                <p>

                    Tuberculosis has been entwined with humanity for millennia. Once romanticized as a malady of poets, today tuberculosis is seen as a disease of poverty that walks the trails of injustice and inequity we blazed for it.
 
                    In 2019, author John Green met Henry Reider, a young tuberculosis patient at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. John became fast friends with Henry, a boy with spindly legs and a big, goofy smile. In the years since that first visit to Lakka, Green has become a vocal advocate for increased access to treatment and wider awareness of the healthcare inequities that allow this curable, preventable infectious disease to also be the deadliest, killing over a million people every year.

                <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px;">George K Mullins</p>
                <h4> </h4>
                <p>
                    Foxhole is a deeply personal story of a young man's experience in World War II. George Mullins takes us on his journey as he travels from his isolated home in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia to the beach in Normandy as part of the Allied invasion, then landing in a glider in the liberation of Holland, next came the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium, and on to the occupation of Germany. Mullins shares his thoughts as he fires his machine gun from freezing foxholes, sees the devastation of war, and develops deep friendships with comrades in arms. In these thoughts, observations, experiences, and fears; the day-to-day reality of war comes to life.

            <h2>The Serviceberry: Abundance and Reciprocity in the Natural World</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px;">Deckle Edge</p>
            <h4>From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Braiding Sweetgrass, a bold and inspiring vision for how to orient our lives around gratitude, reciprocity, and community, based on the lessons of the natural world.</h4>
            <p>
                As Indigenous scientist and author of Braiding Sweetgrass Robin Wall Kimmerer harvests 
                serviceberries alongside the birds, she considers the ethic of reciprocity that lies at 
                the heart of the gift economy. How, she asks, can we learn from Indigenous wisdom and the 
                plant world to reimagine what we value most? Our economy is rooted in scarcity, competition, 
                and the hoarding of resources, and we have surrendered our values to a system that actively harms
                what we love. Meanwhile, the serviceberry's relationship with the natural world is an embodiment
                of reciprocity, interconnectedness, and gratitude. The tree distributes its wealth—its abundance 
                of sweet, juicy berries—to meet the needs of its natural community. And this distribution ensures 
                its own survival.”
