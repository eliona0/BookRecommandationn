                    <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px;">Codie Sanchez</p>
                    <h4>Rich people know a secret. In this book, former Wall Street investor Codie Sanchez pulls back the curtain.</h4>
                    <p>

                        Most people look for wealth in all the wrong places. From dropshipping and startups to grinding for promotions, you might believe you have to trade your life to be one of the few who win. 
                        But the truly rich know these paths are paved with delusion and false promises.
                        
                        In Main Street Millionaire, Codie Sanchez teaches you the path the wealthy really walk. Instead of risking it all with little chance of success, she shows you how to acquire cash-flowing businesses that are winning right now.
